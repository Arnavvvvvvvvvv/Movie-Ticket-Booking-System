# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Ticket Booking System (C++ & MySQL)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a **console-based Movie Ticket Booking System** developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and integrated with **MySQL** for persistent seat reservation data.

The system allows:
- Viewing seat layout (available/reserved seats)
- Reserving tickets
- Storing and updating seat status in a MySQL database

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **OOP-based design** with a dedicated `Seats` class for seat management.
- **Database integration** with MySQL for real-time seat availability.
- **Persistent storage** â€” reserved seats remain reserved even after restarting the program.
- **Input validation** for seat number and row number.
